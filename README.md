## **Week 1 - The Beginning**
This introductory week I learned how to use Tinkercad, autodesk's online web application which simulates an arduino and other other electrical components. This gave me a fundamental understanding of the arduino microcontroller and how it works in practice.

*Create a speculative sci-fi machine using only parts from this lab.* \

I pictured an AI sleeping. I wanted to show a sense of organicness with just LEDs so this is them illustrating a sort of robotic sleep using a cyber-equivalence of breathing. Eventually the artificial intelligence has a nightmare which is indicated by the red warning light. The user has to press the button to reset or calm down the AI so it can return to a deep sleep.

## **Week 2 - Sensors and Serial Data**
This week I got my first look at the different sensors which were compatible for the arduino. I also revised some basic circuitry such as the effect of ohms law and serial vs parrallel.
### Lab 00
*How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?* \
TODO \
*How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage?* \
TODO 
### Lab 01
*Tell a short story with the serial monitor based on player input.* \
TODO 
### Lab 02
*Hook up a knob and have it change the brightness of an LED* \

### Lab 03
*Hook up an LDR. Try making the LED change brightness depending on the light level.* \

### Lab 04
*Working in groups of 4 or 5, pick one of the sensors below from your kit. To find out more about each one google the sensor + the magic word datasheet. Also, sensor + Arduino is a useful one. Hook it up and be prepared to explain to the class how to works next week.*
Unfortunatley I was unable to find a group so I undertook this exercise on my own. I opted to investigate the LDR sensor. \
***How it works***\

### Lab 05
Think about how these kits could be used in the environment around your home. Invent a device relevant to your daily life using the above parts. What does it help you do? What are the possible use cases for this device? What interactions does it afford the user? Design or sketch an enclosure, and include a video of the circuit working (or a tinkercad link). Feel free to be inspired by the above readings. \
***LDR use case*** \
![week2](week2/lab%205%20enclosure.jpg)\
Roughly sketched above, I designed a system which would allow a plant owner to control the amount of light their plant gets, automatically. This may be useful for perhaps exotic plants with particularly demmanding light requirements. It works using an ldr which would be placed upon a stick implanted in the soil/pot of the plant - much like plant support skewers. This is then discretely connected to a fake plant across the window sill. This would contain the arduino in the flower pot, along with three LEDs that act as a traffic light, giving the user feedback on the lighting situation. The top of the pot will have a motor connected through gears to the blind controls which would allow the blinds to extend and contract to fulfil the lighting needs. \
