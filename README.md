## **Week 1 - The Beginning**
This introductory week I learned how to use Tinkercad, autodesk's online web application which simulates an arduino and other other electrical components. This gave me a fundamental understanding of the arduino microcontroller and how it works in practice.

### Lab 04
*Create a speculative sci-fi machine using only parts from this lab.* \

I pictured an AI sleeping. I wanted to show a sense of organicness with just LEDs so this is them illustrating a sort of robotic sleep using a cyber-equivalence of breathing. Eventually the artificial intelligence has a nightmare which is indicated by the red warning light. The user has to press the button to reset or calm down the AI so it can return to a deep sleep.

## **Week 2 - Sensors and Serial Data**
This week I got my first look at the different sensors which were compatible for the arduino. I also revised some basic circuitry such as the effect of ohms law and serial vs parrallel.
### Lab 00
*How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?* \
TODO \
*How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage?* \

### Lab 01
*Tell a short story with the serial monitor based on player input.* \
TODO 
### Lab 02
*Hook up a knob and have it change the brightness of an LED* \
