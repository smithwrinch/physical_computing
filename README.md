## *Week 1 - The Map is Not the Territory*
This introductory week I learned how to use Tinkercad, autodesk's online web application which simulates an arduino and other other electrical components. This gave me a fundamental understanding of the arduino microcontroller and how it works in practice.
### Lab 01
### Lab 02
### Lab 03
### Lab 04
TASK: create a speculative sci-fi machine using only parts from this lab. \
OUTCOME: Sleepy AI\
I pictured an AI sleeping. I wanted to show a sense of organicness with just LEDs so this is them illustrating a sort of robotic sleep using a cyber-equivalence of breathing. Eventually the artificial intelligence has a nightmare which is indicated by the red warning light. The user has to press the button to reset or calm down the AI so it can return to a deep sleep.
## **Week 2 - Sensors and Serial Data**
This week I got my first look at the different sensors which were compatible for the arduino. I also revised some basic circuitry such as the effect of ohms law and serial vs parrallel.
### Lab 00
TASK1: How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?\
OUTCOME: TODO
TASK2: How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage?\
OUTCOME: TODO
### Lab 01
TASK: Tell a short story with the serial monitor based on player input.\
OUTCOME: TODO
### Lab 02
TASK: Hook up a knob and have it change the brightness of an LED\
OUTCOME: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9rm1CvY0a8d-week-2-lab-02/editel?sharecode=CBZNycEl1QY8UXv4IiIwtMK9QRfQ3l8SNbjwVh-zg4Q
### Lab 03
TASK: Hook up an LDR. Try making the LED change brightness depending on the light level.\
OUTCOME: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bl1YzlihyOE-week-2-lab-03/editel?sharecode=J586jMNTMFPWYOX2suSdtlEVMe9ZxzMhJWeie6GQRNo
